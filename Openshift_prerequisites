Setting up a 3-node OpenShift cluster manually requires a significant amount of preparation and configuration. This guide will give you an overview of the steps involved in creating a simple 3-node cluster. For a production setup, you'd typically have at least 3 control plane (master) nodes and multiple worker nodes, but in this example, we will use 1 master node and 2 worker nodes.

### **1. Infrastructure Setup**:

#### 1.1. VM Provisioning:
- Provision 3 VMs or physical servers.
- For this example: 1 master node, 2 worker nodes.

#### 1.2. Networking:
- Set static IPs for each node.
- Ensure hostname resolution is set (either through DNS or `/etc/hosts`).

#### 1.3. Load Balancer (Optional but recommended):
- Setup a load balancer for distributing API requests to the master and for application traffic.

### **2. Install Prerequisites**:

#### 2.1. Docker or CRI-O:
OpenShift supports container runtimes like Docker and CRI-O. Choose one and install it on all nodes.

#### 2.2. Dependencies:
Install required dependencies on all nodes:
```bash
sudo yum install -y wget git net-tools bind-utils yum-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct openssl-devel httpd-tools NetworkManager python-cryptography python2-pip python-devel python-passlib java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless "@Development Tools"
```

### **3. Install OpenShift**:

#### 3.1. Get OpenShift binaries:
Download the OpenShift binaries and place them in your path (usually `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`):
```bash
wget https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/download/v<version>/openshift-origin-client-tools-v<version>-<hash>-linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xzvf openshift-origin-client-tools*.tar.gz
sudo mv openshift-origin-client-tools-*/oc /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv openshift-origin-client-tools-*/kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

Replace `<version>` and `<hash>` with appropriate values.

#### 3.2. Bootstrap the Cluster:
On the master node:
```bash
oc cluster up --public-hostname=<master_public_IP> --skip-registry-check=true
```

### **4. Join Worker Nodes**:

#### 4.1. Prepare Nodes:
Ensure Docker or CRI-O is correctly set up on the worker nodes.

#### 4.2. Join Cluster:
On each worker node:
```bash
oc cluster join --master=<master_public_IP>
```

### **5. Post Installation**:

#### 5.1. Router and Registry:
Deploy the internal OpenShift router and Docker registry:
```bash
oc cluster add router
oc cluster add registry
```

#### 5.2. Storage:
If you want persistent storage, you may need to configure storage classes, persistent volumes, and other storage components suitable to your infrastructure.

#### 5.3. Add Additional Components:
You can install other OpenShift components like logging, monitoring, etc., as needed.

This guide provides a high-level overview of setting up a basic OpenShift cluster. Many detailed configurations, particularly around security, networking, and storage, are glossed over for simplicity.

It's essential to always refer to the official OpenShift documentation for the version you're installing. The setup process can vary between versions, and the official documentation will provide the most accurate and detailed steps.
