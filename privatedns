To integrate Private DNS in Microsoft Azure, you can follow these general steps:

Sign in to the Azure portal: Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in using your Azure account.
Create a Private DNS Zone: In the Azure portal, navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Private DNS Zone." Provide a name for your private DNS zone, select the subscription, resource group, and choose "Private" for the registration mode.
Add DNS records: Inside the created Private DNS Zone, you can add DNS records like A, CNAME, and PTR records for your resources.
Link Virtual Networks: Go to the "Virtual Network" resource you want to associate with the Private DNS zone. Under "Settings," click "Private DNS Zones," then "Add new" and choose the relevant Private DNS zone you created earlier.
Configure DNS settings for Virtual Networks: In the Virtual Network settings, click on "DNS servers" and select "Azure Provided" or "Custom" to configure your preferred DNS server settings.
Test the Private DNS resolution: Ensure that your resources inside the virtual network are using the configured DNS settings and test if the Private DNS resolution is working as expected.
Keep in mind that specific steps and options may vary based on the Azure portal's updates and your subscription type. Always refer to the official Azure documentation for the latest and most accurate instructions.
