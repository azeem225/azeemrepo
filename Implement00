## 6. Service Observability, Monitoring & Logging

### 6.1 Monitoring Set-up
- **Step 24**: Configure an endpoint to expose consolidated metrics.
- **Step 25**: Integrate and configure Grafana for custom dashboard views.

### 6.2 Logging Set-up
- **Step 26**: Implement centralized logging using MLaaS (Elastic Stack).
- **Step 27**: Set different retention policies for different types of logs.

## 7. App Logic Development

### 7.1 Frontend Development
- **Step 28**: Create the frontend web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Step 29**: Implement functionalities: Display tasks, create new tasks, and view task details.

### 7.2 Backend Development
- **Step 30**: Set up the Spring Boot environment.
- **Step 31**: Implement required REST API endpoints.
- **Step 32**: Configure the backend to interact with the chosen database.
- **Step 33**: Utilize persistent volume for task attachments storage.

## 8. Testing and Deployment

### 8.1 Testing
- **Step 34**: Conduct unit tests on both frontend and backend components.
- **Step 35**: Perform integration tests to ensure components interact properly.
- **Step 36**: Validate data storage and retrieval on both MySQL and MongoDB.

- **Step 42**: Provide user manuals for the frontend and backend systems.

### 9.2 Handover
- **Step 43**: Organize a system walkthrough for stakeholders.
- **Step 44**: Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments.
- **Step 45**: Officially hand over the system for operational use.

## Final Note

Post-implementation, it's essential to have a maintenance plan in place and provide training sessions for relevant personnel. This step-by-step plan can be further refined based on detailed technical specifications, available resources, and any unforeseen challenges that arise during the implementation.
